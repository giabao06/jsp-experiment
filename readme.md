# a java webapp experiment

because apparently I have to program a java web app at the university in the next semester now. might as well find out about it first. nothing too interesting.

the stack: gradle + spring boot + apache tomcat + maybe sqlite

## how to build, according to spring people

- `gradle bootRun`: direct run
- `gradle bootJar`: jar file output
